# poke-play-app
A basic CLI application written in Python. "Poke_play," as it shall be called. Make calls to the PokÃ© API and use the data to simulate opening a Booster Pack in the PokÃ©mon TCGP. I am building this because I am salty for not being able to acquire a Mew Ex in the mobile game, and so, I'll build my own fucking version of it to play on my machine. Thank you very much ðŸ™„
