# Poke Play - A Pok√©mon TCGP Booster Pack Simulator

A simple command-line application that uses the PokeAPI to simulate opening Pok√©mon Booster Packs in the TCGP.

## Features

- Simulates opening a Pok√©mon Booster Pack containing 5 random Pok√©mon.
- Special Easter egg for user "DannyBimma" that ensures he always gets Mew ü•π
- Displays basic Pok√©mon information including:
  - Name
  - Pok√©dex number
  - Type

## Requirements

Before running the application, your machine should have:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- pip (Python package manager)
- Internet connection (to access PokeAPI)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/poke-play.git
cd poke-play
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests
```

3. Make the script executable (Unix/MacOS):

```bash
chmod +x poke_play.py
```

## Usage

You can run the application in two ways:

1. Using Python directly:

```bash
python3 poke_play.py
```

2. As an executable (Unix/MacOS):

```bash
./poke_play.py
```

Follow the prompt, enter your Pok√©mon username, and the program will simulate a Booster Pack opening from the Pok√©mon TCGP game and display what you got. Although, if you're not "DannyBimma" your chances of getting Mew are next to impossible‚Äîa direct inverse of reality ü•≤

## Code Structure

### Main Components

1. `Pokemon` Data Class

   - Stores individual Pok√©mon information:
     - name (str)
     - id (int)
     - types (List[str])

2. `PokedexAPI` Class

   - Handles all API interactions
   - Methods:
     - `all_pokemon()`: Gets total number of available Pok√©mon
     - `get_pokes()`: Fetches specific Pok√©mon by ID
     - `load_booster_pck()`: Creates random booster pack

3. Helper Functions
   - `display_pck()`: Formats and prints booster pack contents to console

### API Integration

The application uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a free and open Pok√©mon data API. Specifically:

- API URL: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2
- Endpoints used:
  - `/pokemon`: Get total Pok√©mon count
  - `/pokemon/{id}`: Get specific Pok√©mon data

### Error Handling

The application includes basic error handling for:

- API connection issues
- Invalid Pok√©mon IDs
- Timeout scenarios after 69 seconds; amiright üòú!!
- Data parsing errors

## Example Output

```
Please enter your Pok√©mon TCGP username: "DannyBimma"
